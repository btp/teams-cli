# teams-cli

A Command Line Interface (or TUI) to interact with Microsoft Teams

## Status

The CLI only let you log-in and fetches your user and conversations, but just displays the former.
This project is still WIP and will be updated soon with new features. The goal is to
have a CLI / TUI replacement for the Microsoft Teams desktop client.

## Usage

```bash
go run ./main.go
```
